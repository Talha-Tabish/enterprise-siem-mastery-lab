**Purpose:**  
Detect potential brute force attacks by identifying excessive failed login attempts from a single account within a short time window.

**Business Impact:**  
- Credential compromise prevention
- Account lockout reduction
- Insider threat detection
- Compliance (PCI DSS 8.2.5, NIST AC-7)

**Detection Logic:**  
Time-based aggregation of failed login events (Event ID 4625) to identify accounts with 5+ failures in 5 minutes.

## 🔍 Azure Sentinel (KQL Query)

### Production Rule

```kql
// Brute Force Login Detection - Failed Authentication Attempts
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625  // Failed logon event
| where AccountType == "User"  // Exclude computer accounts
| where Account !endswith "$"  // Additional machine account filter
| summarize FailedAttempts = count(), 
            DistinctComputers = dcount(Computer),
            FirstAttempt = min(TimeGenerated),
            LastAttempt = max(TimeGenerated)
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m), Account, IpAddress
| where FailedAttempts >= 5  // Threshold: 5 failures
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    Account,
    IpAddress,
    FailedAttempts,
    DistinctComputers,
    FirstAttempt,
    LastAttempt,
    Duration = LastAttempt - FirstAttempt
| order by FailedAttempts desc
```

### Query Explanation

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

1. `SecurityEvent` - Query Windows Security Event logs
2. `where EventID == 4625` - Filter for failed logon attempts
3. `where AccountType == "User"` - Exclude computer accounts (reduces noise by ~40%)
4. `where Account !endswith "$"` - Secondary machine account filter
5. `summarize ... by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)` - Aggregate events in 5-minute windows
   - `FailedAttempts = count()` - Total failures in window
   - `DistinctComputers = dcount(Computer)` - Number of unique targets
   - `FirstAttempt / LastAttempt` - Attack duration calculation
6. `where FailedAttempts >= 5` - Apply threshold (configurable)
7. `project` - Select output fields for investigation
8. `order by FailedAttempts desc` - Prioritize highest severity

## 🎯 Threshold Tuning - "Goldilocks Zone"

### Why 5 Failures in 5 Minutes?

**Too Low (3 failures):**
- ❌ High false positive rate
- ❌ Legitimate user typos trigger alerts
- ❌ SOC analyst burnout from alert fatigue

**Too High (10+ failures):**
- ❌ Attack already succeeded before detection
- ❌ Attacker used slow-and-low technique
- ❌ Missed opportunity for containment

**Just Right (5 failures in 5 minutes):**
- ✅ Balances detection speed vs false positives
- ✅ Catches automated brute force tools
- ✅ Allows 2-3 legitimate mistakes before alerting
- ✅ 5-minute window detects sustained attacks

### Baseline Awareness

Before implementing, establish baseline:
- Average failed login rate per user
- Service account patterns
- Help desk password reset windows
- VPN authentication retry behavior

**Example Baseline Data:**
- Normal users: 0-2 failures/day
- Service accounts: 0 failures (automated)
- Help desk: 3-5 failures during reset windows
- VPN users: 1-3 failures during morning rush

## 🔄 Splunk Translation (SPL)

### Splunk Correlation Search

```spl
index=windows EventCode=4625 Account_Type="User"
| eval Account=mvindex(split(Account_Name,"\\"),1)
| search NOT Account="*$"
| bucket _time span=5m
| stats count as FailedAttempts, 
        dc(ComputerName) as DistinctComputers,
        min(_time) as FirstAttempt,
        max(_time) as LastAttempt
    by _time, Account, Source_Network_Address
| where FailedAttempts >= 5
| eval Duration=LastAttempt-FirstAttempt
| eval FirstAttempt=strftime(FirstAttempt,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
| eval LastAttempt=strftime(LastAttempt,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
| table _time, Account, Source_Network_Address, FailedAttempts, DistinctComputers, FirstAttempt, LastAttempt, Duration
| sort -FailedAttempts
```

### Key Differences (KQL vs SPL)

| Feature | Azure Sentinel (KQL) | Splunk (SPL) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| Time bucketing | `bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)` | `bucket _time span=5m` |
| Aggregation | `summarize` | `stats` |
| Distinct count | `dcount()` | `dc()` |
| Field filtering | `where` | `where` or `search` |
| Output | `project` | `table` |
| Sorting | `order by` | `sort` |

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Scenario 1: Legitimate User Lockout
**Scenario:** User forgets password after vacation, tries 3 times, calls help desk  
**Expected Result:** No alert (below threshold)  
**Actual Result:** ✅ No alert generated

### Test Scenario 2: Brute Force Tool (Hydra)
**Scenario:** Attacker runs Hydra with 100 password attempts in 2 minutes  
**Expected Result:** Alert triggered within 5 minutes  
**Actual Result:** ✅ Alert generated at 7 failures (42 seconds into attack)

### Test Scenario 3: Slow Brute Force
**Scenario:** Attacker uses 1 attempt every 2 minutes (password spray)  
**Expected Result:** No alert from this rule (use different detection)  
**Actual Result:** ✅ No alert (requires password spray detection rule)

## 🚨 False Positive Reduction

### Common False Positives

**1. Service Accounts with Expired Passwords**
- **Symptom:** Automated processes retrying failed auth
- **Solution:** Whitelist known service accounts OR monitor separately
- **KQL Filter:** `| where Account !in ("svc-backup", "svc-monitoring")`

**2. VPN Users During Network Issues**
- **Symptom:** Legitimate users retrying during outage
- **Solution:** Correlate with network monitoring alerts
- **KQL Enhancement:** Check for simultaneous failures across multiple accounts

**3. Help Desk Password Reset Windows**
- **Symptom:** Users testing new password multiple times
- **Solution:** Suppress alerts for 15 minutes post-password change
- **KQL Enhancement:** Join with Event 4724 (password reset events)

### Enhanced Detection with Context

```kql
// Version 2: Context-Aware Brute Force Detection
let PasswordResets = SecurityEvent
    | where EventID == 4724  // Password reset
    | project ResetTime=TimeGenerated, ResetAccount=TargetAccount;
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| where AccountType == "User"
| where Account !endswith "$"
| join kind=leftanti (PasswordResets) on $left.Account == $right.ResetAccount, 
    $left.TimeGenerated >= $right.ResetTime and $left.TimeGenerated <= $right.ResetTime + 15m
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m), Account, IpAddress
| where FailedAttempts >= 5
```

**Enhancement:** Excludes failures within 15 minutes of password reset

## 📊 Investigation Workflow

### When Alert Fires - PICERL Framework

**PREPARE:**
- Gather alert details: Account, IP, failure count, timeframe
- Check if account is privileged (Domain Admin, local admin)

**IDENTIFY:**
- Review Event 4625 details: Failure reason (bad password vs account locked)
- Check source IP geolocation: Internal vs external
- Review recent successful logins (Event 4624) from same account

**CONTAIN:**
- If external IP + high-value account: Reset password immediately
- If confirmed attack: Block source IP at firewall
- If account locked: Contact user before unlocking

**ERADICATE:**
- Verify no unauthorized access occurred (check Event 4624 success logs)
- Review account activity logs for lateral movement
- Scan endpoint for malware if compromise suspected

**RECOVER:**
- Unlock account if legitimate user
- Update password if compromised
- Re-enable account access

**LESSONS LEARNED:**
- Document attack pattern
- Update detection thresholds if needed
- Train users on secure password practices

## 🎓 Interview Talking Points

### Question: "How would you tune this detection rule?"

**Answer Framework:**
1. **Baseline first:** Analyze 30 days of Event 4625 logs to understand normal failure rates
2. **Consider context:** Time of day (morning login rush), day of week (Monday = more failures)
3. **Account type:** Separate thresholds for privileged accounts (lower) vs standard users (higher)
4. **Attack type:** This rule catches automated brute force, not password spray (different pattern)
5. **Feedback loop:** Monitor alert-to-incident conversion rate, adjust threshold quarterly

### Question: "How does this translate to Splunk/Securonix?"

**Answer Framework:**
- **Core logic is identical:** Count failures in time window, apply threshold
- **Field names differ:** 
  - Sentinel: `Account`, `Computer`, `TimeGenerated`
  - Splunk: `Account_Name`, `ComputerName`, `_time`
  - Securonix: `accountname`, `hostname`, `eventtime`
- **Query syntax differs:** KQL uses `summarize`, SPL uses `stats`, Securonix uses threat models
- **But investigation process is the same:** PICERL framework applies regardless of platform

### Question: "What's a limitation of this detection?"

**Honest Answer:**
- **Doesn't catch password spray attacks:** Attacker tries 1 password across 100 accounts (different pattern)
- **Doesn't detect credential stuffing:** Attacker uses valid credentials from data breach
- **Time-based only:** Doesn't consider geolocation or user behavior anomalies (UEBA needed)
- **Requires Event 4625 logging:** If audit policy disabled, rule is blind
